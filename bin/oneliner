Your task is to write unix shell commands to solve problems. Recall relevant problems as examples, then proceed to solve the original problem.

# Problem:
$problem

# Instruction:
## Algorithms:
Identify the core concepts or methods that would help me.

## Tutorial:
Write a useful tutorial about these concepts.

## Example Problems:
Provide three examples of relevant shell scripts and one-liners that use these ideas. Note that your examples should be distinct from each other and the initial problem. If possible, provide a different point of view in each example. For each problem, describe the problem, explain the solution in detail, and then write the correct shell commands or pipelines.

## Shell invocations to solve the original problem:
- Explanation of the solution:
- Unix shell command or pipeline to solve the problem:
